\begin{abstract}
Many weather station networks lack sufficient representativeness, and
their station density is often inadequate to capture spatial and
climatic variability effectively. Optimal site selection is therefore
essential to enhance spatial coverage and improve data quality. This
study proposes a methodology for identifying optimal sites for a
meteorological station network in the Dominican Republic, utilizing a
multi-criteria decision-making framework based on the Analytic Hierarchy
Process (AHP) and neighborhood analysis. Using the H3 library as a
spatial indexing tool, zonal statistics were derived from geospatial
variables, including seasonality, habitat heterogeneity, proximity to
water bodies, slope, solar radiation, and elevation. Expert-defined
weights were assigned to each variable based on their relative
importance. Areas with high topographic and climatic variability were
prioritized to maximize spatial representativeness. Results highlight
thermal and precipitation seasonality, elevation, and solar radiation as
the most influential variables, emphasizing the need to collect data in
elevated areas with marked seasonality. Sites were evenly distributed
across three density scenarios, ensuring robust climatic and topographic
coverage while avoiding redundancy through proximity constraints to
existing stations. The proposed network would provide essential data for
meteorological and climatic research in the region. Future studies
should assess the accessibility and feasibility of the selected sites
and incorporate additional environmental variables into the framework.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Weather stations (WS) are essential for collecting accurate and
up-to-date data on weather and climate in specific regions. The
applications of the data collected by WS extend beyond meteorology and
climatology, finding widespread use in fields such as engineering,
agriculture, urban planning, and geography, among others (Chung et al.,
2018; Marchi et al., 2019; Wilgen et al., 2016; World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) \& The International Association of Hydrological
Sciences, 1976). The data provided by these stations are instrumental in
predicting extreme weather events, such as tropical storms, hurricanes,
tornadoes, and droughts, enabling communities to prepare and respond
effectively. Furthermore, WS data underpin numerous scientific studies
on climate and climate change, helping to better understand atmospheric
dynamics and their impacts on the planet, ultimately contributing to
more informed and effective planning strategies (World Meteorological
Organization (WMO), 1996, 2017a, 2017b).

A robust WS network is crucial for making informed decisions across
various domains and is fundamental for the well-being and safety of
communities and the environment. Planning an adequate WS network is
essential for effective land management. Previous studies, including
those conducted in the Dominican Republic, reveal significant gaps in WS
coverage in key areas and highlight the uneven spatial distribution and
low density of existing networks, which likely affect the accuracy of
collected data (Frei, 2003; Programa Mundial de Alimentos (PMA), 2019;
Rojas Briceño et al., 2021; Theochari et al., 2021).

Many countries have evaluated the design of their WS networks, sometimes
revisiting and improving them multiple times, often with successful
implementations (Frei, 2003). Some have developed site selection
protocols that align with general World Meteorological Organization
(WMO) standards, adapting or extending them to meet the specific needs
of their territories and intended applications (Rojas Briceño et al.,
2021; Theochari et al., 2021).

The Dominican Republic is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate
change, and an insufficient WS network exacerbates this vulnerability
(Izzo et al., 2010; Le, 2019; Lenderking et al., 2020; Lohmann, 2016;
Mackay \& Spencer, 2017; Roson, 2013). Improving and expanding the WS
network requires investment in technology and infrastructure, as well as
partnerships among government agencies, private entities, and research
institutions (Programa Mundial de Alimentos (PMA), 2019). However, to
optimize the use of limited resources, it is critical to design,
evaluate, and select network alternatives using weighted criteria.

Research on the design of weather station networks consistently
identifies multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods as ideal for
this purpose (Köksalan et al., 2011; Taherdoost \& Madanchian, 2023;
Thiriez \& Zionts, 1975). These methods leverage geospatial data and
include public input spatially integrated into decision-making using
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) (Chakhar \& Mousseau, 2008; Eastman
et al., 1998; Malczewski, 2004; Rojas Briceño et al., 2021;
Tekleyohannes et al., 2021; Theochari et al., 2021). Studies have
demonstrated the effectiveness of traditional geostatistical techniques
(Ali \& Othman, 2018; Valipour et al., 2019), contemporary deep learning
algorithms in combination with traditional methods (Safavi et al.,
2021), and entropy-based approaches (Bertini et al., 2021). Combining
geospatial data (e.g., GIS and remote sensing) with multi-criteria
analysis (MCA) that assigns relative weights to geographical criteria is
particularly efficient for analyzing diverse variables (Rojas Briceño et
al., 2021).

The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a well-established multi-criteria
decision-making (MCDM) method, is widely used due to its simplicity, its
ability to provide insights into the analyzed attributes, and its
structured framework for incorporating expert input (Rojas Briceño et
al., 2021). Developed by Thomas Saaty in the 1970s (Saaty, 1977) and
refined in subsequent decades (Saaty, 2001; Saaty \& Tran, 2007), AHP is
used to make decisions involving multiple criteria and alternatives.
Traditionally applied in engineering, social sciences, economics, and
business, AHP has recently been utilized effectively for selecting
optimal WS sites in Peru (Rojas Briceño et al., 2021).

AHP involves breaking down a complex problem into a hierarchical
structure of criteria and subcriteria, followed by pairwise comparisons
to assign relative importance. The process includes identifying
objectives and criteria, structuring them hierarchically, conducting
pairwise comparisons, calculating priority values for criteria, and
ranking alternatives based on aggregated priorities.

In this study, we integrate the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) with
geospatial and expert-driven data to systematically identify optimal
sites for meteorological and climatic stations in the Dominican
Republic. We prioritize key environmental and accessibility criteria to
maximize spatial and resource efficiency while minimizing redundancy in
existing networks. Additionally, we propose actionable scenarios for
network expansion that align with international standards, offering
solutions to address data gaps in poorly covered regions. Through this
research, we advance geospatial methodologies and decision-support
frameworks for meteorological infrastructure planning, with potential
applications in broader climatological and environmental sciences.

\section{Materials and Methods}\label{materials-and-methods}}

We applied a sequence of four interdependent steps to develop
alternative designs for weather station (WS) networks, emphasizing the
multi-criteria selection of sites prioritized for their deployment.
First, we gathered data on the existing WS network through consultations
(via forms and visits) with government agencies, including the Dominican
National Meteorological Office (ONAMET, now the Dominican Institute of
Meteorology, INDOMET) and the National Institute of Hydraulic Resources
(INDRHI). These forms were created and managed using the Open Data Kit
(ODK) platform (Get ODK Inc., 2024; Hartung et al., 2010). We also
consulted private entities managing WS networks. These efforts resulted
in consolidated information on station locations, operational status,
and other relevant attributes. This step ensured that the analysis was
grounded in an accurate and comprehensive understanding of the current
state of the WS network.

Subsequently, we implemented an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to
select the optimal option among different alternatives using selection
criteria weighted by individuals with expertise in the problem (Saaty,
2013). The selected criteria were distance to access points, thermal
seasonality, rainfall seasonality, habitat heterogeneity, distance to
water bodies, slope, hours of direct sunshine, elevation. These eight
criteria were chosen based on their relevance to the problem, supported
by our expertise as well as previous studies and recommendations from
the World Meteorological Organization (Rojas Briceño et al., 2021; World
Meteorological Organization (WMO) \& The International Association of
Hydrological Sciences, 1976).

We explicitly requested expert consultations, asking respondents to
complete questionnaires electronically. After collecting the responses,
we organized and recoded the data, then evaluated their consistency. We
used only consistent responses to establish the criteria weights, which
were subsequently applied to the available geographic information
sources, including approximately
\href{https://geofis.github.io/zonal-statistics/README.html}{13,000
hexagons containing the corresponding multi-criteria information
distributed across the Dominican Republic} (Martínez-Batlle, 2022).
Afterwards, we created these hexagons using the H3 spatial index library
from Uber and computed zonal statistics with Google Earth Engine (GEE)
(Gorelick et al., 2017; Uber Technologies, Inc., 2024). Specifically, we
employed the GEE Python API to process the data programmatically, using
packages like \texttt{geemap} for map visualization and data handling
(Google Earth Engine Contributors, 2023; Wu, 2020). Finally, we assigned
each hexagon an aggregated priority category, choosing from four
possible options: marginally prioritized, moderately prioritized,
prioritized and essential.

We designed the questionnaires, processed the responses, and weighted
the criteria of geographic information sources using programming
languages. These tasks were performed in the R statistical programming
environment with the following packages: \texttt{ahpsurvey},
\texttt{sf}, \texttt{raster}, \texttt{terra}, \texttt{ggplot2},
\texttt{tidyverse}, \texttt{kableExtra}, \texttt{spdep}, \texttt{units},
\texttt{knitr}, and \texttt{rmarkdown} (Cho, 2019; Hijmans, 2023, 2024;
Pebesma et al., 2016; Pebesma, 2018; Pebesma \& Bivand, 2023; R Core
Team, 2024; Wickham et al., 2019; Xie, 2014; Xie et al., 2020; Zhu,
2021). We also used Python to automate the design of questionnaires and
their integration with Google Forms via its API.

Subsequently, we used the AHP results as input for a constraint-based
exclusion process. In this step, we carefully analyzed the hexagons to
identify those located in areas where accessibility was limited or where
proximity to water bodies posed challenges. Hexagons situated near or
within water bodies were deemed unsuitable for hosting meteorological
stations and were excluded from further consideration. This process
ensured that only feasible locations remained for the next steps of the
analysis.

Finally, we conducted a neighborhood analysis between existing and
proposed stations to ensure spatial homogeneity and avoid redundancy.
First, we generated optimized station locations using a custom algorithm
based on convex hulls and distance maximization. This method iteratively
selected points that maximized their distance from previously chosen
points, ensuring an optimal spatial distribution aligned with the
station density criteria recommended by the World Meteorological
Organization (World Meteorological Organization (WMO), 2020; World
Meteorological Organization (WMO) \& The International Association of
Hydrological Sciences, 1976). Subsequently, we used continuous distance
surfaces (e.g., rasters) as part of the neighborhood analysis to
eliminate proposed stations that were too close to existing ones,
thereby avoiding redundancy. Detailed methodological steps can be found
in the \protect\hyperlink{infosupl}{Supplementary Information}.
